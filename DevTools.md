Development Tools
=================
This page exists as my soapbox for listing various resources I recommend (along with some I don't, but I believe in options, so...)

Take everything with a grain of salt and understand that there are other tools out there, this is just a starting point for these things

Version control
---------------
Tracks versions of your code, and facilitates development in teams. Check <whyscm.md here> for why you should use this.

There are several version control systems out there, pick one, and stick with it.

### Git
A distributed source code management system.

* [The official site][git-home]
* [Git for compsci][git-cs] - a quick explanation about how git works internally
* [MSysGit][git-msysgit] - git for windows (includes shell extensions)
* [TortoiseGit][git-tortoisegit] - an alternative GUI for git (you still need msysgit)
* [EGit][git-egit] - eclipse plugin (it lack support for most git features, but it covers the basics)

[git-home]: http://git-scm.com/  "Git Homepage"
[git-cs]: http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/ "Git for computer scientists" 
[git-msysgit]: http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/ "MSysGit"
[git-tortoisegit]: http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/ "TortoiseGit"
[git-egit]: http://www.eclipse.org/egit/ "Egit"

### SVN - centralized
http://tortoisesvn.net/ - really good gui for windows
http://subclipse.tigris.org/ - eclipse plugin

Build automation
----------------
anything that automates building your software. Check <whyba.md here> for why you should use this.

Dependency management
---------------------

Hosting
-------
Everyone needs hosting at some point. The good news is that there are literally thousands of hosting services out there. The bad news is that most of them are horrible.

### Shared Hosting
Shared hosting is where you share a server with other customers. This is the cheapest form of hosting, but also the most restrictive. Often, you won't have access to recent versions of software, if at all.

* <http://greengeeks.com/ Green Geeks LLC.> - They offer dirt cheap shared hosting with good support. I use them.
* <http://a2hosting.com/ A2Hosting> - Extremely similar to GreenGeeks. I also use them (don't ask).

### SaaS
SaaS services offer a specific application and only that application for you. For example, a hosting service that offers Git repository hosting is SaaS.

#### SCM
* <http://offers.assembla.com/free/ Assembla> free hosting for repos. I haven't used them, so beware.
* <http://unfuddle.com/ Unfuddle> another place offering free hosting for repos. I haven't used them
* <http://www.gitenterprise.com/ Git Enterprise> a free place to host git repos. I use them.
* <http://www.github.com/ GitHub> free git repo hosting for open source projects. I use this, and share several projects.
