This is a post of accomplishments from 2019, gathered throughout the year. Some of these will be vague, some verbose. I'll include links to what I can.

I know this is being published more than halfway through 2020, but I feel it's important to clear out my backlog at this point.

# Q1:

- Grew my family to include a beautiful baby girl.

# Q2:

- Created a SublimeText plugin for my personal todo list

# Q3:

- Not much worth mentioning

# Q4:

- Ordered a micro:bit to begin learning and practicing embedded development
