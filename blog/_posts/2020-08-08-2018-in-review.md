This is a post of accomplishments from 2018, gathered throughout the year. Some of these will be vague, some verbose. I'll include links to what I can.

I know this is only being published in 2020, but I thought it would be good to clear out the backlog I've had for the last few years

# Q1:

- Finished a rather tough semester. Made up a lot of hours on Friday mornings. Not fun, but worth it. I feel like I've "leveled up" after the courses, they forced me to learn a more mathematical side of CS that I hadn't seen before.

# Q2:

- Not much worth mentioning

# Q3:

- Decided to grow my family. Mixes of excitement, terror, and happiness. Expecting a girl in January 2019.

# Q4:

- Began my third year of MSc studies. I can see the end nearing, and it makes me excited.
- Finally published a binary bomb exercise in python I wrote back in Q1.
- Worked on heavy profiling of our systems at work to increase throughput. Learned a lot and wrote a lot of tools for flamegraphs.
