This is a post of accomplishments from 2017, gathered throughout the year. Some of these will be vague, some quite verbose. I'll include links to what I can.

I know this is only being published in 2020, but I thought it would be good to clear out the backlog I've had for the last few years

# Q1:

- Wrote a system for tracking the health of external services. Not particularly interesting on its own, but it "*just works*".
- Migrated one legacy server into three VMs. This involved solving several frustrating problems, not the least of which was remembering that [sudoers is last-match-wins][1] in order to run [rsync as root][0] on both the legacy and replacement servers.
- Wrote a set of [githooks][2] for creating a multi-primary cluster. Harder than it seems, and my implementation is far from perfect.
- Learned just how much time I need for studying for classes, and that I had attempted to take too many.

# Q2:

- Started learning VHDL development. Ordered a development board to work on some side projects.
- Finally opened a company for [Feedio][feedio], and promptly discovered my previous startup attempt was not dissolved properly.
- Started using a custom class file for LaTeX files. Nothing too fancy, but better than copying around the same stuff all the time.

# Q3:

- Finished the spring semester. Didn't go as well as I had hoped or expected, but I learned a lot, mostly about the way I learn and my own abilities.
- Set up [LaTeX][katex-post] support for my blog.
- Started learning devops seriously, and applying what I had learned both at work and for my personal projects.

# Q4:

- Registered karas.io as a domain name. Time to start self-hosting!
- Rescued a server with a borked storage controller. Turns out it's a known issue with certain HP servers, and required flashing a new firmware.
