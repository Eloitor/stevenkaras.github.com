I've started my own company to handle my paid projects. We have a small team of skilled developers, and are in contact with the greater community, so we can handle projects of just about any size. Our work is the highest quality, and we strive to ensure that the client gets what they need, and what they want.

Some software houses will charge exorbitant rates just to meet with a client and perform a specification. At NCS, we are willing to sit down with you and discuss how best to complete your project. Moreover, we utilize advanced development methods to ensure quality and client satisfaction.
