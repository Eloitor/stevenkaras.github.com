User Experience matters. More than just about anything else, excepting core functionality. Great user experiences make great applications, and horrible UX design can doom your application, and your venture, to failure.

First and foremost, let's define user experience. It's different than UI, and very different from graphic design. UX is the holisitic view of how your users interact with your application, from beginning to end. There are some technical terms I'll throw around, but this post is aimed at everyone who works on software projects, from product managers to customer support. Each and every single person who works on these projects is part of the user experience, and responsible for it.

There are different analytic metrics for tracking your UX performance. Things like daily active users, user attrition, and k-factor are all important measures. The only real metric, however, that matters is revenue. If your revenue goes down, it doesn't matter how many DAU you have, or if your k-factor is 10. But they can be good leading indicators for revenue, especially when considered within a smaller context: revenue-generating features. Even for businesses for whom direct user revenue isn't part of their model, these are extremely important metrics, and keeping track of them is incredibly important.

Having a bad UX leads to higher attrition. High attrition means fewer users over time, and reputation is a strong factor in attrition rates. Here in Israel, cell phone companies fates rise and fall with angry posts on facebook, facing literally thousands of customers who will cancel plans at the same time based on horror stories (or waiting on hold for longer than usual for customer service). They failed to recognize that the support process is an important part of UX, and that not just software companies need to consider UX.

Fewer users (especially paying ones) means lower revenues, which if you aren't wary can quickly translate to losses, layoffs, and looking for a new job. The new world order is quite simply companies that care about UX, while those who don't die off quickly.
