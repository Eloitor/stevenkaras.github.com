This is part of a series on UX design. In this post, we'll cover when and where to use animations in your UX. Animations look great! They wow executives, salespeople love them, and your friends think what you're doing is so cool. The problem here is that everyone except the end user think it's a good idea. Animations are abused in so many ways, by so many apps, it's not even funny. Let's explore when and how to use animations to make your application jump off the screen and be fun to interact with.

The purpose of an animation is to draw the user's attention to a particular component, provide a smooth transition to add context to the interaction, or to indicate that something is being processed (such as a progress bar or spinner). When deciding whether to add an animation, ask if the use case falls into one of these three scenarios. If it doesn't, don't add the animation.

If you must animate something, make it subtle. Humans evolved to notice movement; most users' reaction to a wiggling control is to instantly pay attention to it. Making it too apparent or having too many can leave your users with an unpleasant feeling. Unpleasant feelings are soon followed by uninstalls and refund requests or service cancellations, which translates directly into lost revenues.  Aside from keeping the animation subtle is to ensure that the animation can be interrupted, and doesn't prevent interaction with the control. Microsoft gave us the perfect example of this, where you had to wait until Clippy would finish jumping out from behind a sheet of paper before dismissing him.

The rule of thumb for animations is that they are a luxury feature, and while they may make your user interface "pop", they will generally interrupt the user's workflow. Interrupting your users too much makes your application difficult to use effectively. Your efforts are better spent on gathering analytics data on how your users interact with the application.
