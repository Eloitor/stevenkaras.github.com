This is part of a series on UX design. In this post, we'll cover when and where to use animations in your UX. Animations look great! They wow executives, salespeople love them, and your friends think what you're doing is so cool. The problem here is that everyone except the end user think it's a good idea. Animations are abused in so many ways, by so many apps, it's not even funny. Let's explore when and how to use animations to make your application jump off the screen and be fun to interact with.

The purpose of an animation is to draw the user's attention to a particular component, provide a smooth transition to add context to the interaction, or to indicate that something is being processed (such as a progress bar or spinner). When deciding whether to add an animation, ask if the use case falls into one of these three scenarios. If it doesn't, don't add the animation.

The rule of thumb for animations is that they are a luxury feature, and while they may make your user interface "pop", they will generally interrupt the user's workflow. Interrupting your users too much makes your application difficult to use effectively.


For starters, don't use them. They may wow the executives, and make your pitch look that much better. But the users will very quickly learn to hate that damn cartoon paperclip that has to finish bouncing out from behind the sheet of paper before they can interact with it. Not to mention that it's a waste of resources that could be better spent doing other things, like gathering analytics on how your users interact with your application.

If you do feel the need to use animations, keep in mind where they fit best. A good animation is subtle, gently drawing the attention of the user towards a particular control. Wiggling a control by rotating it and moving it slightly back and forth has a profound effect on what is important. We evolved to discriminate movement quickly, and most users' reaction to a wiggling control is to instantly pay attention to it. Overdoing it means that your user will feel like he's being forced to pay attention to something, which provokes the same reaction as a used car salesman shouting louder than all the other commercials on TV.

While animations can attract attention, and provide a smoother transition, they can also disrupt the users' workflow. Especially if the UI element can't be interacted with until the animation finishes. The only good reason for this is if the UI element isn't ready to be interacted with, in which case you should make it clear that it's not ready, by making a button dimmed, or slapping up a "Now Loading..." indicator on top of it.
