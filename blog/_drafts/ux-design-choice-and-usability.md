This is part of a series on UX design. In this post, we'll cover why giving your users real choices grants them true freedom. The specific type of freedom I'm talking about here is the freedom to choose their own workflow. While it makes sense that you'll have a primary workflow that you develop against primarily, it shouldn't limit your support of other workflows.

Microsoft forcing users to restart their computers after installing minor updates is a great example of this. I'm not talking about the recent versions where you have an option of postponing the restart, but rather the older versions which literally forced Windows to restart after 30 seconds. More recently, Adobe has been guilty of this, forcing users to restart after installing flash or acrobat updates, sometimes with countdown timers.

In order to preserve this choice, avoid forcing the user to dismiss anything. Use asynchronous interactions rather than modal dialogs. Avoid taking action without user interaction. Do these, and your users will love your program, and likely invent new workflows you didn't expect.
