This post is part of a series on UX design principles.

Talking about how to improve your application's usability is a good thing, but it can be hard to measure a particular proposal's merits. Let's discuss some ways to measure a UX, and compare designs to each other.

Now, we'll assume that usability is an unquantifiable value, which means that A can be better than B, B can be better than C, and C can be better than A. Makes your mind spin, right? But we can say that A is better than both B and C for most (or at least those that interest us) use cases. The key here is to talk about specific use cases. Ranking which use case is more important than any other is up to your marketing department, and not the purpose here.

Since we can't use raw usability as a measure, let's just refer to the usability for a given use case as the usability of the UX.

Now, there are many different measures that make up the aggregate usability of a UX. I'm not going to suggest how to compile the individual measures, since it depends on the use case, but rather I'm just going to discuss what they are, and some simple ways to improve them. For each measure, we need to answer a fundamental question about our UX. It's important to remember that sometimes the answers aren't important so much as the process that it takes to get there.

Single Screen Principle:

* is all the information the user needs on the same screen?

Modality:

* does the user need to "switch modes" to complete the task?

* if so, how often?

* also, how much time/effort does it take to switch modes?

Ease of Access:

* how complicated are the input sequences required to take the necessary actions?

* How many mouse clicks does it take to finish a tootsie roll pop

There's a pattern that Apple started using that is by and large the single most impressive improvement to UX in the last decade. They took a price display, and turned it into a button that when clicked twice, would purchase that item. The underlying principle here is to keep all the information the user needs on one screen, and reduce any mode switching involved in confirming an action.

To generalize the concept further, almost any simple yes or no confirmation (ok/cancel) that is initiated by a button press can be changed to use this 4-state button (instead of the traditional 3 state) that displays a "ok?" or similar prompt to confirm the action.
